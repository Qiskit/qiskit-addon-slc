    The parallelization of the forward and backward unequal time commutator bound
    computation has been reworked internally. As a result, long-running single
    tasks no longer cause other tasks to idle until the next circuit layer can
    be processed but instead all processes remain utilized at all times.
    Consequently, the perceived time-to-completion has shortened considerably
    when running with many parallel processes.

    In addition to the above, a user may now use a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` signal
    to terminate the bound computation manually, which will be handled gracefully
    and preserves all results computed thus far.
